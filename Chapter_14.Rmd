## Notes for Chapter 14 Strings

### 14.1 Introduction

This chapter will focus on the stringr package for string manipulation. stringr is not part of the core tidyverse because you donâ€™t always have textual data, so we need to load it explicitly.

### 14.2 String basics

Beware that the printed representation of a string is not the same as string itself, because the printed representation shows the escapes. To see the raw contents of the string, use writeLines():

```{r ch1421}
x <- c("\"", "\\")
x
writeLines(x)
print(x) # equivalent to line 27, x

?"'" #for help with special characters

```
Functions from stringr start with `str_`

```{r ch1422}

x <- c("Apple", "Banana", "Pear")
str_sub(x, 2, -2)
```

### 14.3 Matching patterns with regular expressions

```{r ch1431}

x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "an")

```
